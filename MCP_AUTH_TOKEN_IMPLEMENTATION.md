# MCP_AUTH_TOKEN Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Implementation
- Added `authToken?: string` property to the `MyMCP` class
- Added `setAuthToken()` method to set the authentication token
- Modified `callFastAPI()` to include the token in the Authorization header as a Bearer token
- Updated context objects to include the auth token for tools, prompts, and resources

### 2. Token Extraction
The server now extracts auth tokens from three sources (in order of preference):
1. **Query Parameter**: `?auth_token=your-token-here`
2. **Authorization Header**: `Authorization: Bearer your-token-here`
3. **Environment Variable**: `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` (for Cloudflare Worker deployment)

### 3. Type Updates
- Updated `ToolContext`, `PromptContext`, and `ResourceContext` interfaces to include optional `authToken` property
- Updated `worker-configuration.d.ts` to include `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` in the environment type

### 4. Tool Enhancement
- Updated the `get_role` tool to also display authentication status
- Changed description from "NOT used anywhere" to "Get the current User Role and authentication status"

### 5. Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation in README.md explaining all three methods to provide auth tokens
- Created this summary file for implementation details

## Usage Examples

### Claude Desktop Configuration with Auth Token

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mlcd-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://remote-mcp-server.matthew-ludwig.workers.dev/sse?auth_token=your-token-here"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### API Request Flow
1. MCP client connects to SSE endpoint with auth token
2. Cloudflare Worker extracts the token
3. Token is stored in the MCP instance
4. All FastAPI calls include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
5. FastAPI backend can validate the token for authentication

## Important Notes
- The auth token is **optional** - the system works without it
- Tokens are passed to **all** API requests to the FastAPI backend
- The token is logged as "Auth token set" without revealing the actual token value
- Multiple token sources allow flexibility for different deployment scenarios
